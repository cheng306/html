Best known for our bourbon, the U.S. is in the top 10 of countries when it comes to whiskey production worldwide.</p>  \n\n<b>What’s the difference between American whiskey and bourbon?</b>\n\n<p>American whiskey is the category, and bourbon is the type. Bourbon is made primarily from corn, whereas American whiskey can be made from a variety of grains, but both are made exclusively in the United States.</p>\n\n<b>Are There Different Kinds of American Whiskey?</b>\n\n<p>America is well known for its diversity, and our whiskey is no different. We might be best known for our bourbon, but there are actually several types of American whiskey. Typically categorized by the ingredients used in the distillation process, here are the most common types of American whiskey.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Bourbon whiskey: By far the most popular type of American whiskey, bourbon is made from at least 51% corn (maize).</li>\n\n<li>Tennessee whiskey: Usually made from corn in a similar style to bourbon, but with a maple filtration system post-distillation.</li>\n\n<li>Rye whiskey: made from at least 51% rye and is a style common in other countries as well.</li>\n\n<li>Malt whiskey: aged in charred, unused oak barrels and made from at least 51% malted barley.</li>\n\n<li>Wheat whiskey: pretty mellow for an American whiskey and made from at least 51% wheat.</li>\n\n<li>Corn whiskey: made from at least 80% corn and is an old fashioned whiskey that’s currently experiencing a resurgence in the whiskey world.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<b>What Does American Whiskey Taste Like?</b>\n\n<p>Because there are so many styles, taste really varies. If you’re busting open a bottle of bourbon, expect strong vanilla, oak and caramel flavors. Tennessee whiskey is like bourbon but smoother and sweeter, thanks to slow filtration through sugar-maple charcoal after it’s distilled. Rye whiskey has a unique spice, while wheat whiskey is sweet and mellow.

For a tequila to qualify as an añejo, it must be aged at least one year in an oak barrel, though most añejos age between one and three years (if it’s aged longer than three years, it’s referred to as an “extra añejo”).</p>\n\n<p>The wood imparts notes of vanilla and spices, rendering añejo a very cozy and highly sippable tequila; generally speaking, this rich and decadent spirit is intended to stand on its own and sipped neat rather than mixed into a cocktail (though you do you, slugger). The barrel aging also gives añejo a darker, amber hue. It’s quite a stark—and delicious—departure from its more ubiquitous sibling, blanco tequila.</p>\n\n<b>What’s the best way to drink añejo tequila?</b>\n\n<p>Think of añejo like a nice, rich bourbon; with all that complexity, it’s really meant to be enjoyed neat so you can appreciate the full spectrum of its flavors. But if you’re really keen on mixing up a cocktail that features añejo, the same still applies: a good bourbon cocktail recipe highlights the warm, rich, baking spice & vanilla-y notes, and thus swapping out bourbon for añejo if you’re partial to tequila is a pretty smooth move.</p>\n\n<b>Can I get añejo tequila delivery?</b>\n\n<p>You bet.

It’s bottled immediately after distillation in stainless steel, whereas añejo and reposado tequilas are aged. As such, it offers grassy, citrusy, black peppery notes, where its aged cousins feature a richer and bolder flavor profile.</p>\n\n<p>While a super smooth blanco tequila can be sipped neat or on the rocks, blanco’s straightforward distillation process means it’s a great blank canvas for a cocktail (like margaritas, obvs).</p>\n\n<b>Are blanco tequila and silver tequila the same thing?</b>\n\n<p>They are indeed, though we get that it’s a little confusing. “Blanco” in Spanish translates to white, not silver, and blanco tequila is neither white nor silver, but clear. So. There’s that. But if a tequila is referred to as blanco or silver, that means it’s coming straight to the bottle after distillation, with no aging. Another way to think of it: it’s just really, really excited to be a part of a marg and doesn’t want to wait any longer than it has it.</p>\n\n<b>What’s the best way to drink blanco or silver tequila?</b>\n\n<p>An ultra smooth blanco tequila can and should be sipped neat or on the rocks. A more common blanco or silver tequila is a terrific backbone for your favorite tequila-based cocktail, like a margarita, paloma, tequila soda or tequila sour.</p>\n\n<p>And we’d be remiss to not mention that if you’re going to do tequila shots, well, an everyday blanco is probably a good way to go. Shots aren’t really the time to really ponder over the nuance of the grass notes, etc.</p>\n\n<b>Can I get blanco or silver tequila for delivery?</b>\n\n<p>Absolutely.

While about 95% of bourbon is made in Kentucky, there’s no law that says it has to be produced there. </p>\n\n<b>What’s The Difference Between Bourbon and Whiskey?</b>\n\n<p>Bourbon is whiskey, but not all whiskey is bourbon. According to U.S.law, Bourbon is exclusively made in the United States, stored in new charred oak barrels at 125 proof or less, contains no additives and is distilled from at least 51% corn-mash. The definition of whiskey is less restrictive, it can be distilled from a variety of grains without restrictions on storage and comes from anywhere in the world whiskey is made.</p>\n\n<b>What Kind Of Bourbons Are There?</b>\n\n<p>Traditional Bourbon is usually made from 60-80% distilled corn-mash with only small amounts of other grains added for fermentation and flavor.</p>\n\n<p>Wheated Bourbon is made from 51% or more distilled corn-mash, with the second greatest grain being wheat. Wheated bourbon has a creaminess to its mouth-feel, with a prickly sweet flavor that’s a little lighter than the traditional recipe.</p>\n\n<p>Rye Bourbon is made from 51% or more distilled corn-mash and around 20% distilled rye. This gives the bourbon a spicy kick that complements the sweetness of the corn, without the full-on zing of a rye whiskey, which is made from 51% or more rye.</p>\n\n<b>What Does Bourbon Taste Like?</b>\n\n<p>You’ll never really know unless you try it, but bourbon is typically characterised by flavors of vanilla, oak, caramel and spice.</p>\n\n<b>How Do You Drink Bourbon?</b>\n\n<p>Any way you want!

It is a red wine that was historically sold in squat, round bottles in straw holders called fiasco. Nowadays, winemakers prefer to sell chianti in typical red wine bottles - only kitschy Italian restaurants keep the straw bottles, usually right next to a cartoon chef throwing a cartoon pizza.</p>\n\n<b>Is chianti a good wine?</b>\n\n<p>Tuscans are quite proud of chianti. Production is bound by many regulations to ensure no inferior products can infect the market. For instance, chianti must be made with at least 70% Sangiovese grapes. That level of quality control means you always know what you’re getting when you buy a bottle of chianti.</p>\n\n<b>Is chianti dry or sweet?</b>\n\n<p>Like the straw it used to be served in, chianti is very dry. Actually, chianti makers have recently considered allowing for the production of sweeter chianti to attract a wider audience of wine drinkers and help keep chianti a popular export.</p>\n\n<b> What is the flavor of chianti?</b>\n\n<p>Chianti has strong cherry flavors, with an oaky must underneath. It tastes best when it has aged and can grow fuller-bodied in flavor. It is a great wine to have with dinner, particularly any Tuscan dishes like steak florentine or ravioli in meat sauce.</p>\n\n<b> What is the difference between chianti, chianti classico and chianti reserva? </b>\n\n<p>Remember those production regulations? They include different categorizations for chianti that have higher percentages of Sangiovese grapes and are aged longer. Plain “chianti” is only required to have 70% Sangiovese grapes and is aged just three months, while chianti classico needs to have 80% Sangiovese and age for 10 months. Some chianti classico is “reserva,” meaning it has been aged for two years.</p>\n\n<b>What are the best chiantis?</b>\n\n<p>Scoring a 92 on Wine Enthusiast,  <a href=\"https://www.saucey.com/wine/red-wine/chianti/tommasi-amarone-classico-01/RW-T10312-750ML\">Tommasi Amarone Chianti Classical</a> is an absolute delight as its notes of black cherry and plum blossom on one’s palate.

Between the 1600s-1800s, cider was even used to pay people for their labor. So yeah, it was once worth its weight in gold. Have a sip of dry, off-dry, semi-dry, or semi-sweet hard cider and you’ll be asking for the whole pint soon. </p>\n\n\n<b>How is hard cider made? </b>\n\n<p>Hard cider is made from fermented fruit. More specifically, it’s mostly made from apples. The apples get washed until they’re squeaky clean, then they’re ground down into a pulp, pressed for juice, and fermented. BAM. Hello cider. </p>\n\n<b>Are there different types of hard cider?</b>\n<p>Totally. Hard cider is rated on a scale of sweet to dry. You get the sweeter cider after the fermentation process is done and you’ve added artificial sweeteners, and you get a dryer cider during the fermentation process when all of the natural sugar is converted into alcohol. </p>\n\n<b>Do hard ciders have less ABV?</b>\n<p>On average, hard ciders contain around 4 to 6 percent alcohol. Hard ciders have an ABV that is comparable to most craft beers.</p>\n\n<b>Does hard cider contain gluten? </b>\n<p>Nope, hard cider is naturally, and gorgeously gluten-free. HOORAY.</p>\n\n\n<b>How do you drink hard cider?</b> \n<p>Hard cider is best served chilled in a glass. Classic.

Depending on the variety of rum, the alcohol is produced through the fermentation of sugarcane molasses or sugar juice. The end result is a clear liquid generally higher than 80 proof (and up to 151 proof—heeey, Bacardi). </p>  \n\n<p>Due to its tropical roots, rum is very often the main alcohol used in all your favorite vacation cocktails like piña coladas, mojitos, daiquiris and hurricanes. Rum is in pretty much most alcoholic beverages that are served with a cocktail umbrella.</p>  \n\n<p>Dark rum refers to the finished style of the rum, and there are three main types: dark, white, and spiced.</p>  \n\n<b>What is the difference between dark rum and white rum?</b>\n\n<p>Both dark and white or light rum are the result of the fermentation of sugarcane juice or molasses, and the end result is a clear liquor. Whereas light rum generally undergoes minimal aging in stainless steel (and thus retains its light or clear coloring), dark rum is aged in oak, much like whiskey.</p>  \n\n<p>As is true with the aging process in general, white or clear rums are lighter in flavor and have therefore often been used in mixed drinks where the complexity and deep flavors of the rum are not necessarily the focus. </p>  \n\n<p>A dark rum, on the other hand, takes on new and deeper flavors during the aging process. Depending on the distiller and batch, a dark rum can contain notes of spice, tropical fruit, vanilla and caramel.</p>  \n\n<b>What’s the best way to drink dark rum?</b>\n\n<p>Because dark rums tend to be more complex than their lighter counterparts, a nice rum can absolutely be sipped neat or on the rocks. For rum enthusiasts, there’s quite a distinction between column-distilled Cuban rums, and pot-distilled rums from Jamaica or Barbados. The latter tends to be more full-bodied and pronounced in its sugarcane flavors. </p>  \n\n<b>What cocktails use dark rum?</b>\n\n<p>Like their light counterparts, dark rums are great for tropical drinks. That means a piña colada, daiquiri, Planter’s Punch, Dark ‘N Stormy or a Mai Tai are all excellent choices. Dark rum can also pair very well with something simple; think rum & Coke with a twist of lime (also known as a Cuba Libre).</p>  \n\n<b>Does Saucey deliver dark rum?</b>\n\n<p>You bet!

In modern times, English-style brown ales are generally divided into two categories: a style produced in Northern England, which yields a medium-bodied, reddish-brown ale a la Newcastle, and a rarer style produced in Southern England, which is darker in color but lighter in body, and tends to be sweeter.</p>\n\n<p>Either way you slice it, it’s not a hoppy beer, and despite its darker coloring, it tends to be on the lighter side and is highly drinkable.

Wheat beer is any beer made from at least 50% wheat. While there’s a variety of wheat beers offering complex flavor profiles, for the most part wheat beers tend to be light, summer-y and refreshing.</p>\n\n<b>What Kind of Wheat Beers Are There?</b>\n\n<p>The first wheat beers started in Germany. Since then, the style has taken on a life of its own with a variety of offshoots. Here are a few of the most popular styles.</p>\n\n<p>Hefeweizen: A Bavarian style beer known for being light in color, cloudy with notes of banana, bubblegum, and clove. </p>\n\n<p>Witbier: A Belgian style wheat beer that is similar to a Hefenweizen, but with unique flavors of orange peel and coriander. </p>\n\n<p>Berliner Weisse: A northern Bavarian style wheat beer that’s light and sour. It’s often mixed with fruit like raspberries, peaches or citrus. </p>\n\n<p>American Wheat: Obviously we couldn’t let Germany have all the wheat beer fun. American wheat beer is generally lighter and more adaptable, with some extra hoppy editions.</p>\n\n<b>Is Wheat Beer Healthier?</b>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, no. Just because a beer uses whole wheat, malted wheat, or isn’t filtered, doesn’t mean it’s healthier. Most mass-produced wheat beers have around 170 calories, similar to any other full-strength brew.</p>\n \n<b>What Does Wheat Beer Taste Like?</b>\n\n<p>Summer in a bottle. Wheat beers are usually lighter and more carbonated, so they’ve got a thick foamy head and a complex flavor profile including banana, clove, orange peel and coriander.</p>\n\n<b>What is Rye Beer?</b>\n\n<p>Rye can be added to any type of beer, but it works particularly well in complex beers like IPAs. So, rye isn’t a style of beer so much as an additive used in the brewing process. Regardless of the style, in order to be considered a ‘rye beer’ it must use a significant amount of rye in the brewing process and have strong rye flavors present in the finished product. </p>\n\n<b>What Does Rye Beer Taste Like?</b>\n\n<p>The addition of rye will add a unique spice to any beer, often compared to pumpernickel bread. Rye also enhances the color of beer by giving it a robust red tint. #instagramready</p>\n\n<b>Can I Get Wheat & Rye Beer Delivery?</b>\n\n<p>You know Saucey’s got you covered.

IPAs are currently the most popular beer in America, and they’re one of the most brewed craft beers of all time. IPA stands for India Pale Ale, which was originally brewed from a pale malt and shipped from the East India Company, where it got it’s name. IPAs are known for their high alcohol content and strong, earthy aromas, just like Lil’ Wayne.</p>\n\n<b>What Does An IPA Taste Like?</b>\n<p>Even though IPAs are popular, they’re not for everyone. Novice beer drinkers tend to be turned off by the the bitter flavor and strong hoppy aftertaste. People usually call IPAs an \"\"advanced beer” or describe them as “complex.” Just like everything else you’re not allowed to have as a kid, it’s an acquired taste.</p>\n\n<b>American IPAs</b>\n<p>American IPAs have a very distinctive flavor from the American hops, but even within the US, the flavors change from coast to coast. East coast IPAs tend to taste more malty, which helps counteract all the hops, whereas West Coast IPAs double down and go for full-on hops overload. The West Coast is also known for brewing “Double IPAs” that are richer and stronger than traditional pale ales, while the East Coast is known for adding fruity, floral flavors to their beer.</p>","footer":"","google_product":"414","search_tags":"IPA","icon":"","url_name":"india-pale-ale","ordinal":null,"parent_id":"59a8c3684505d2893ab4c56c","created":"2017-09-01T02:18:35.296Z","updated":"2021-06-17T17:31:57.836Z","url_path":"undefined/beer-cider-hard-seltzers/india-pale-ale","manual_url_path":false,"discount_override":null,"discount_percent":1,"discount_modifier":null,"base":false,"platforms":["web"],"gift":false,"google_category":"Food, Beverages & Tobacco > Beverages > Alcoholic Beverages > Beer","dynamic_rules":{"min_sell_price":0,"georestricted":[],"max_sell_price":0,"package":false},"dynamic":false,"enabled":true,"__v":4,"image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/saucey/image/upload/v1527119678/a7chzigmrjg6f2iyqyuw.jpg","point_value":0,"point_multiplier":1,"root":false,"is_alcohol":true,"is_tobacco":false,"display_products":true,"display_subcategories":false,"root_category_display":[],"display_subproducts":true},"product_count":9},"78":{"category":{"_id":"59a8c3684505d2893ab4c581","tag":"78","v2":true,"name":"Irish Whiskey","subtitle":"","description":"","url":"irish-whiskey","seo_title":"Iris Whiskey Delivery Near You In 30 Minutes | Saucey","seo_description":"Get your favorite Iris whiskey delivered near you within 30 minutes.

As you might imagine, Irish whiskey can only be produced in Ireland and must be aged for a minimum of 3 years. Known for its smooth and subtle sweetness, this whiskey can be great for either a nice wind down after a long day or an absolute turn up.</p>\n\n<b>What kind of Irish whiskey’s are there? </b>\n<p>Blended Whiskey: A mixture of different single malt whiskeys.The most famous kind of Irish whiskey, like Jameson.</p> \n\n<p>Single Malt Whiskey: Produced by one distillery in a pot and made from 100 percent malted barley. </p>\n\n<p>Single Pot Still Whiskey: Unique to Ireland, a yummy blend of both malted and unmalted barley that’s distilled in a pot still.</p>  \n\n<p>Grain Whiskey: A lighter style. Produced in column stills, and made from corn or wheat.</p>\n<p>Single Grain Whiskey: Same as grain whiskey, but they’re made in a single distillery. </p>\n\n<p>Potcheen: This one is a little closer to moonshine, and it doesn’t meet the three year minimum age requirement to be labeled as Irish whiskey, but it’s a must if you want to know Irish whiskey.</p>\n\n<b>What makes Irish whiskey different from scotch? </b>\n\n<p>Some say the only difference between scotch whisky and Irish whiskey is the spelling of the word “whiskey” itself. Scotch famously loses the, “e” - it’s their thing. But there’s more to it than that. While both of them are fermented with barley, Irish whiskey is smooth, triple distilled, and mostly unmalted. Scotch, on the other hand, is smokey, malted, and usually distilled twice. </p>\n\n<b>How do you drink Irish whiskey?</b>\n\n<p>If you’re not an avid Irish whiskey drinker, adding water to your drink is not a bad thing. In fact, water actually opens up the whiskey, so you get some of the aromas you might not have while drinking it neat. If you like simple mixed drinks, ginger ale is a great addition. But if you’re really looking for a great drink, we recommend whipping up a nice Old Fashioned. Thank us later. </p>\n\n<b>Can I get Irish whiskey delivery?</b>\n\n<p>Can you? That’s what we do!

There are quite a few other pinot varieties, but when someone casually drops something like, “I’m about to order an extremely crushable pinot from Saucey right now,” into a conversation, they’re almost certainly talking about pinot noir. That’s because it’s the most popular lighter-bodied <a href=“https://web-dev.saucey-api.com/red-wine” style=“color: #EE614C”>red wine</a> in the world.</p>\n\n<b>Is pinot noir a good wine?</b>\n<p>“Good” is subjective, but of course. But a good bottle of pinot noir is kinda like The Beatles in their prime; it’s all but impossible not to thoroughly enjoy it. Pinot’s roots can be traced back to the Burgundy region in France (oh la la) and historically, the difficulty of growing the grapes created scarcity, and with scarcity comes, in part, prestige. But in more modern times, other regions have likewise made names for themselves in the pinot game. Check out Joel Gott hailing from Oregon; La Crema from Sonoma, California; and Yellow Tail from Australia.</p>\n\n<p>And yes, the protagonist’s obsession with pinot noir in the movie Sideways did indeed play a big part in the wine’s current popularity. </p>\n\n<b>Is pinot noir dry or sweet?</b>\n<p>Sweetness in wine comes from residual sugar, of which pinot noir generally has none or very little. Pinot is fruity, though, and its high acidity lends a juiciness to it that may register for some as “sweet.” </p>\n\n<p>It’s made in a dry style, which means natural sugars from the grapes are converted into alcohol by yeast during the fermentation process. A truly sweet wine like a port or even a riesling utilizes a method in which fermentation is stopped before all the sugar is converted into yeast.</p>\n\n<b>What is the flavor of pinot noir?</b>\n<p>Generally, a pinot noir exhibits a red-berry fruitiness, with little hints of mushroom and what wine peeps sometimes call “forest floor”—like, literally, that smell of wet-ish leaves on a forest floor. But to keep things simple: pinot noir largely means you’ll get a wine with juicy red berry flavors, but no treacly sweetness.</p>\n<b>What is the difference between pinot noir and merlot?</b>\n<p>Like pinot noir, merlot is a grape variety. As a varietal wine (i.e. merlot is the only grape used), merlot is more full-bodied and tannic than pinot noir. But it’s also used quite often in red wine blends. While much depends on whether a merlot is made in a Bordeaux tradition (i.e. earlier harvest, which yields a lighter and more acidic wine) or in the “international style” which is big flavor, big alcohol, big everything, pinot noir will generally be a lighter red than merlot.</p>\n\n<p>And yes, the protagonist’s constant dogging on merlot in the movie Sideways did indeed drastically decrease merlot’s popularity. But merlot is making a comeback, especially with smaller producers—stay tuned.</p>","footer":"","google_product":"421","search_tags":"","icon":"","url_name":"pinot-noir","ordinal":0,"parent_id":"5769c97729c54c2b71db6efa","created":"2017-09-01T02:18:27.213Z","updated":"2021-06-17T17:31:57.836Z","url_path":"wine/red-wine/pinot-noir","manual_url_path":false,"discount_override":null,"discount_percent":1,"discount_modifier":null,"base":false,"platforms":["web"],"gift":false,"google_category":"Food, Beverages & Tobacco > Beverages > Alcoholic Beverages > Wine","dynamic_rules":{"min_sell_price":0,"georestricted":[],"max_sell_price":0,"package":false},"dynamic":false,"image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/saucey/image/upload/v1528326855/jfzbes5wk0wuz9j6c38w.jpg","point_value":0,"point_multiplier":1,"__v":2,"root":false,"enabled":true,"display_products":true,"display_subcategories":false,"display_subproducts":true,"is_alcohol":true,"is_tobacco":false,"root_category_display":[]},"product_count":10},"110":{"category":{"_id":"59a8c3684505d2893ab4c5a0","tag":"110","v2":true,"name":"Port","subtitle":"","description":"","url":"port","seo_title":"","seo_description":"","url_prefix":true,"html":"","footer":"","google_product":"421","search_tags":"","icon":"","url_name":"port","ordinal":0,"parent_id":"5769c97729c54c2b71db6efa","created":"2017-09-01T02:18:27.405Z","updated":"2018-01-26T20:32:39.524Z","url_path":"wine/red-wine/port","manual_url_path":false,"discount_override":0,"discount_percent":1,"discount_modifier":0,"base":false,"platforms":[],"gift":false,"google_category":"Food, Beverages & Tobacco > Beverages > Alcoholic Beverages > Wine","dynamic_rules":{"min_sell_price":0},"dynamic":false},"product_count":2},"112":{"category":{"_id":"59a8c3684505d2893ab4c5a2","tag":"112","v2":true,"name":"Prosecco","subtitle":"","description":"","url":"prosecco","seo_title":"","seo_description":"","url_prefix":true,"html":"<b>Wine - Prosecco</b>\n<p>Is Prosecco <a href=\"wine\">wine</a> or is Prosecco <a href=\"/champagne\">champagne</a>?

The end result is a tequila that’s a little softer and smoother than a bright, grassy blanco, but not quite as curvacious and warm as an añejo.</p>\n\n<b>Are reposado and añejo tequila the same thing?</b>\n\n<p>They are not. Think of añejo as reposado’s mature older sister; generally speaking, reposado spends half the time aging; as such, it’s still got some of that smoothness of añejo, but it also maintains some of the sharp crispness of a blanco or silver tequila. </p>\n\n<b>What’s the best way to drink reposado tequila?</b>\n\n<p>Reposado is a true middle child—complex enough to be sipped neat, but versatile enough to be the backbone in a tequila-based cocktail. Give it a whirl in a margarita or paloma, or go in for a bottle of the good stuff if you’re looking to sip on some tequila neat. </p>\n\n<b>Can I get reposado tequila for delivery?</b>\n\n<p>Yes, you can!

Contrary to how most whiskey is made, it doesn’t have to be aged for a minimum of any years, but most people age it for at least two. </p>\n\n\n<b>What makes rye whiskey different from bourbon? </b>\n \n<p>Here’s the deal: the process of making rye whiskey and bourbon are actually really similar. Rye whiskey and bourbon are both aged in charred new oak barrels and they’re both bottled at a minimum of 40% ABV. But, the catch is the distinct flavor of rye. Even after aging in charred oak, it doesn’t fully lose its spiciness. </p>\n\n<b>Is rye whiskey gluten-free? </b>\n\n<p>Yes. Hooray! Even if it’s made with wheat, barley, or rye - pure whiskey is gluten-free. However, keep on the lookout for added flavorings, as they could contain gluten that would make your rye whiskey not gluten-free. </p>\n\n<b>How do you drink rye whiskey?</b>\n\n<p>Have you ever had an Old Fashioned, Sazerac, or Manhattan? Did you like it? If yes, it’s safe to say you probably like rye whiskey in your drink. It can also be consumed on the rocks, neat, or with club soda or ginger ale.  </p>\n\n<b>Can I get rye whiskey delivery?</b>\n\n<p>Abso-freakin-lutley.

Aromatically driven, sauvignon blanc will have you tasting zesty fruity flavors and maybe even a subtle hint of bitter green pepper from time to time. </p>\n\n\n<b>Is sauvignon blanc a good wine?</b>\n\n<p>As one of the most popular white wines in the world, we’ll let the wine speak for itself. Why? Because there’s more to sauvignon blanc than just being a “popular white wine.” Sauvignon blanc is straightforward in its flavors. You never need to guess what’s hidden in a glass of good sauvignon blanc. You’ll know right when you take your first sip...after we deliver it to you, of course.</p>\n\n\n<b>Is sauvignon blanc dry or sweet?</b>\n\n\n<p>Traditionally speaking, a white wine like sauvignon blanc is usually on the drier side. This means that sauvignon blanc is made when the natural sugars from the grapes are converted into alcohol. However, that doesn’t mean you can’t find a sauvignon blanc with hints of sweetness. There are actually some winemakers out there that leave in a touch of sugar for a richer taste. </p>\n\n<b>What is the flavor of sauvignon blanc?</b>\n\n\n<p>Depending on if your bottle was made in a cool climate or a warm climate, the subtle flavors of your sauvignon blanc can range from peach and passionfruit (warm climate) to a more herbal, earthy flavor (cold climate). </p>\n\n<b>What food goes well with sauvignon blanc?</b>\n\n\n<p>Since it has herbal hints, sauvignon blanc would go great paired with any green vegetables such as zucchini and asparagus. So get some corn tortillas, roast up some veggies of your choice, sprinkle some cheese and salsa verde on top, and you’ve got yourself the perfect tacos for this wine. Okay, now I know what I’m having for dinner. </p>\n\n<b>Can I get sauvignon blanc delivered?</b>\n<p>Of course! Saucey was invented to do exactly that.

There are actually some winemakers out there that leave in a touch of sugar for a richer taste. </p>\n\n<b>What Food Goes Well with Syrah? </b>\n\n<p>Syrah has moderate acidity and tannins, and a fruity but earthly flavor.

You’ve heard of a jack and Coke and whiskey ginger. It makes the alcohol go down easier and let’s face it, soda is tasty. </li>\n\n<li>Orange Juice: A must add to champagne, sparkingly wine, or tequila. </li>\n\n<li>Tomato Juice: The face of the hair of the dog, the bloody mary is the truest hangover cure.

For centuries, humans have been downing mugs of frothy mead. Year ago, beer was even used as a form of currency. It’s not just a beverage — it’s a pastime. </p>\n\n<p>Many early cultures grew grains and fruit, which were fermented and used to make beer. One of the most popular ingredients was barley, which has been used in beer since 3500 BC. But it wasn’t until the Europeans added hops to the mix in 822 that beer started to resemble its modern form.</p>\n\n<p>In the 1500s the Purity Law was enacted. From then on, the only ingredients allowed in beer were water, hops and barley-malt. During the Industrial Revolution, beer became commercialized and brewed on a large scale. Today, more than 133 billion liters of beer are sold per year on a global scale. </p>\n\n<b>How Is Beer Made?</b>\n<p>Brewing is a complicated process. It starts by converting a malted barley into a sugary liquid called wort. The wort is mixed with hot water in a process known as mashing. </p>\n\n<p>Malt is then added to the and processed in a mash turn for 1-2 hours. During this process, the starches are converted to sugars, and the wort is removed, leaving a sweetened pile of grains.</p>\n\n<p>Next, the grains are washed in a process called sparging (I swear I’m not just making up words). After waking the grains, they’re separated from the wort in a process called lautering (seriously guys?). </p>\n\n<p>Next, the wort is separated into a kettle and boiled. During the boxing process, hops are added as a source of bitterness to counteract the sweet, sugary flavors.</p>\n\n<p>After the boiling process, the wort is cooled, it’s sent to the fermenter where the yeast is added. Over several weeks, the wort slowly turns into sweet, delicious beer. The length of the fermenting process varies depending on the type of yeast and the strength of the beer. </p>\n\n<p>Like your Mama always said; good things come to those who wait.</p>\n\n<b>What Are the Different Types of Beer ?</b>\n<p>Beer  comes in many different styles. Some are light and fruity, others are dark and bold. Some are smooth as silk and others are grainy and rich. The best part? They’re all delicious.</p>\n\n<b>Ale</b>\n<p>Brewed using a warm fermentation method, which gives it a full-bodied fruity flavor. Originally, ale was brewed using gruit instead of hops, but that all changed when the Purity Law went into effect.</p>\n\n<b>There are many different types of Ale, like the following:</b>\n<ul>\n  <li>Brown Ale: Lightly hopped. Mildly flavored. Earthy, nutty flavors.</li>\n  <li>Pale Ale: Bitter. Lighter color and body than traditional ale.</li>\n  <li><a href=\"/india-pale-ale\">India Pale Ale</a>: Extra hoppy. Strong, bold flavors. King of the homebrews.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<b>Lager / Pilsner</b>\n<p>Your first beer was probably a lager. It’s an easy-drinking, flavorful beer brewed in low temperatures. They range from pale to golden brown to dark brown in color. </p>\n\n<b>Pale Lagers:</b> Mildly flavored. Best served cold. Well balanced — not to sweet, not too bitter, not too hoppy.  Most Light Beers are pale lagers..<br>\n<b>Dark Lagers:</b> Less common. Higher alcohol by volume. Bolder, richer flavors. Range from amber to dark brown in color. <br>\n<b>Pilsner:</b> Originally called a blond lager. Somewhere between pale and dark lagers. Think Heineken, Beck’s, and Stella Artois.<br>\n \n<b>Porter / Stout</b>\n<p>Stouts are are dark, rich, and handsome. They’re made by roasting malt and barley hops to darken them and enhance their flavors. They also tend to have higher alcohol by volume. Originally called Stout Porters, they earned their name by being the strongest batch of Porter beers in the 1700s. Technically, there are no differences between Stouts and Porters. But there are a few different types of Stout beers.</p>\n\n<b>Milk Stout:</b>Made using milk, these stouts are sugary sweet. Once believed to have natural healing powers. Still up for debate.<br>\n<b>Dry Stout:</b> The most popular stout style. A direct response to the sweet milk stouts being made in England. Contains small amounts of unmalted roasted barley. Dry and bitter to the taste.  Most famous stout is the Guinness Draught. <br>\n<b>Porter:</b> Flavored with roast malted barley instead of unlimited barley like a stout. Tend to be less bitter than stouts, with slightly less ABV. <br>\n<b>Flavored Stout:</b> In addition to milk, some stouts are flavored with chocolate or oatmeal. <br>\n\n<b>How Do You Drink Beer?</b>\n<p>The best beer comes directly from the source. Bottling or canning requires all of the yeast to be filtered out, which changes the taste. Occasionally, some preservatives are added as well.</p>\n\n<p>The purest form of beer is draught beer, meaning it’s stored in a pressurized keg. Most bars serve select beers on draught, and some retailers even let you purchase your own keg for parties and events.</p>\n\n<p>Storing beer in a pressurized keg causes lots of tiny bubbles to form, which creates a dense head (excess foam), and an almost creamy texture.</p>\n\n<p>When pouring a beer, either from a tap, a bottle, or a can, it’s recommended that you poor slowly to avoid the any excess yeast.</p>\n\n<p>While few can deny the refreshing taste of a ice-cold beer on a hot day, some beer enthusiasts prefer their beer at room temperature, as it brings out its range of flavors. Typically, the rule of thumb is the lighter the beer, the colder the serving temperature. </p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Light beers like pale lagers are best served at 45˚.</li>\n  <li>Dark lagers are best served a little warmer at 48˚</li>\n  <li>Ale and Stout beers start to show the depth of their flavor around 55˚</li>\n  <li>Strong dark ales are best served at 60˚ or even room temperature.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<b>What Are the Best Beers?</b>\n<p>Wow. That’s a big question. It’s tough to say, but the best beer is usually a beer shared with friends, so start there. </p>\n\n<p>Maybe you’re a classic, like a Budweiser or a Pabst Blue Ribbon. </p>\n\n<p>Maybe you’re more of a light beer drinker like Bud Light, Miller Lite, or Coors Light.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe you prefer something a little more cultured, like Stella Artois, Corona Extra, or Guinness.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps you’re more of a craft beer kind of person, like  Lagunitas IPA, Goose Island IPA, or Stone Delicious IPA.</p>\n\n<p>You’ll never truly know until you try them all. The world is your oyster, my friend. And beer are the pearls.</p>","footer":"","google_product":"414","search_tags":"","url_name":"beer","url_path":"beer/beer-cider-hard-seltzers","manual_url_path":false,"google_category":"Food,

delivery is the best way to say thank you</b>\n\n<p>Did somebody do a nice thing for you and you don’t know how to repay them? Or maybe a friend sent you a gift and you’re like “What the heck, Josh! This rocks!” and now you want to send them a gift in return? Let’s be honest, we love the vibes of classic camaraderie. However, showing that you’re grateful is hard to do sometimes. Luckily, booze is the queen of all ice-breaking moments, really. Nothing says thank you like knowing someone’s favorite bottle of Merlot, buying it, and gifting it to them. </p>\n\n<b>What is a good thank you gift?</b>\n\n<p>Depending on how big your thank you is, the most appropriate gifts can range from beer to a nice wine, to a flashy bottle of Ciroc. If your friend just helped you move, a 6-pack of Stella would be perfect and much appreciated. Now, if your friend set you up with the deal of the century, or introduced you to someone important, something a little more special may be in store. Don Julio 1942, anyone? Or perhaps, any sort of top-tier vodka, whiskey, or tequila would do. If you’re looking for a gift that says “I love you, thank you for being my friend!” it’s time to break out the wine. </p>\n\n<b>Should I get red or white wine for a gift? </b>\n\n<p>Ultimately, it’s whatever you think they would prefer. But, if you don’t know that information - check out the weather. Is it summer? Sauvignon Blanc or Rose go perfectly with warm weather. If it’s around fall/winter, you’ll want to keep your eyes peeled for fuller-bodied red wines like a Cabernet Sauvignon or a relaxing Malbec. Lastly, don’t be scared to pick something different - this could be the bottle that introduces your friend to their new favorite wine.</p>\n\n<b>How do I send alcohol as a thank you gift?</b>\n\n<p>Thanks for asking. Start by typing your recipient’s address in the navigation bar. Doing this will automatically update your selection to what’s available in their local selection.

You will then be prompted to either schedule a delivery time or send them a notification that will allow them to schedule a delivery themselves so they can be present to accept the gift. </p>"},"product_count":13},"SUPERBOWL020118":{"category":{"_id":"5a666281ced2ec5b3b174644","tag":"SUPERBOWL020118","url_path":"super-bowl-essentials","created":"2018-01-22T22:15:29.393Z","updated":"2020-01-03T20:16:15.755Z","enabled":false,"name":"Super Bowl Essentials","ordinal":1,"subtitle":"A damn good drink for the big game #likeachampion","url_name":"super-bowl-essentials","interval_start":"2018-02-01T14:00:00.000Z","interval_end":"2018-02-05T07:00:00.000Z","__v":0,"icon":"https://res.cloudinary.com/saucey/image/upload/v1516659520/nszna9plmbvgcagqedrj.png","manual_url_path":false,"discount_override":null,"discount_percent":1,"discount_modifier":null,"base":false,"platforms":["ios","android","web"],"gift":false,"dynamic_rules":{"min_sell_price":0},"dynamic":false,"point_multiplier":1,"point_value":0},"product_count":12},"HG":{"category":{"_id":"5769c97729c54c2b71db6f0b","enabled":false,"icon":"https://files.parsetfss.com/84441d70-2b10-4839-b89e-9bc23e4abb25/tfss-a4e4e4bd-1791-4ce5-abec-8596a9369152-holiday.png","name":"Holiday Gifting","ordinal":25,"subtitle":"Select Items With Gift Packaging","tag":"HG","created":"2017-03-10T06:09:40.697Z","platforms":["web"],"updated":"2020-01-03T20:16:15.770Z","__v":2,"url":"holiday-gifting","manual_url_path":false,"discount_override":null,"discount_percent":1,"discount_modifier":null,"base":false,"gift":false,"dynamic_rules":{"min_sell_price":0,"max_sell_price":0,"package":false},"dynamic":false,"parent_id":null,"url_name":"holiday-gifting","url_path":"holiday-gifting","point_multiplier":1,"point_value":0},"product_count":24},"RET":{"category":{"_id":"5fce99b67d82690cb7ddf3fe","tag":"RET","__v":0,"base":false,"created":"2020-12-07T21:08:06.494Z","discount_modifier":null,"discount_override":null,"discount_percent":null,"dynamic":false,"dynamic_rules":{"min_sell_price":0,"georestricted":[],"max_sell_price":0,"package":false},"gift":false,"is_alcohol":true,"is_tobacco":false,"manual_url_path":false,"name":"Retirement","parent_id":null,"platforms":["web"],"point_multiplier":1,"point_value":0,"root":false,"updated":"2021-06-17T17:31:57.836Z","url_name":"retirement","url_path":"retirement","enabled":true,"display_products":true,"display_subcategories":false,"display_subproducts":true,"root_category_display":[]},"product_count":7},"WB":{"category":{"_id":"603d1e3ed986240d0fa5b962","tag":"WB","__v":1,"base":false,"created":"2021-03-01T17:02:54.336Z","discount_modifier":null,"discount_override":null,"discount_percent":null,"dynamic":false,"dynamic_rules":{"min_sell_price":0,"georestricted":[],"max_sell_price":0,"package":false},"enabled":true,"gift":false,"is_alcohol":true,"is_tobacco":false,"manual_url_path":false,"name":"Wheat Beer","parent_id":"5f21f3ab27d5970cefd3fda6","platforms":["web"],"point_multiplier":1,"point_value":0,"root":false,"updated":"2021-06-17T17:31:57.836Z","url_name":"wheat-beer","url_path":"beer/ales/wheat-beer","display_products":true,"display_subcategories":false,"display_subproducts":true,"root_category_display":[]},"product_count":6},"LMG":{"category":{"_id":"5fd3da5efda3ae4c9644dc2a","tag":"LMG","__v":0,"base":false,"created":"2020-12-11T20:45:18.867Z","discount_modifier":null,"discount_override":null,"discount_percent":null,"dynamic":false,"dynamic_rules":{"min_sell_price":0,"georestricted":[],"max_sell_price":0,"package":false},"enabled":true,"gift":false,"is_alcohol":true,"is_tobacco":false,"manual_url_path":false,"name":"Last Minute Gifts","parent_id":null,"platforms":["web"],"point_multiplier":1,"point_value":0,"root":false,"updated":"2021-06-17T17:31:57.836Z","url_name":"last-minute-gifts","url_path":"last-minute-gifts","html":"<b>Alcohol delivery is the best for last minute gifts</b>\n\n<p>Uh-oh!

Alcohol Delivered to Your Friendsgiving</b>\n<p>With Saucey, you can have all the beer, wine and liquor you want delivered right to the Friendsgiving host’s door. Your friends will rejoice when the doorbell rings and you proudly announce “the beer is here!” And if you really dropped the ball this year and are about to show up to the Thanksgiving celebration empty-handed, we’ve got all the best last-minute wine, beer, and spirit gifts.</p>\n\n<b>What is a good gift to bring to Thanksgiving dinner?</b>\n<p>Booze, of course, and a lot of it. Of all the foods served at a traditional Thanksgiving banquet, alcohol is consistently the most popular “dish.” Definitely more popular than Aunt Brenda’s savory Jell-O salad. Bring a case or two of beer, cider and hard seltzers for the big game before dinner, wines to share at the table, and some liquor to wind down the night. If you happen to run out before dinner is over, just hit us up again! Saucey will be working on Turkey Day to help solve all your drink-related issues. Unfortunately can’t help with your sister’s new boyfriend who hogs all the gravy.You have to figure that out as a family.</p>\n\n<b>Which wine goes best with turkey?</b>\n<p>When it comes to wine pairings, the Thanksgiving roast turkey is an odd duck. It’s poultry, so it can go with a dry white, like Dark Horse Sauvignon Blanc. On the other hand, turkey is much heartier and gamier than other birds, so it also pairs well with fruity red wines like Bogle’s Pinot Noir. And of course, as a celebration, Champagne is always appropriate.  If you’re having trouble choosing, we pre-selected some of our favorite wines that don’t break the bank.</p>\n\n<b>What is a good cocktail for Friendsgiving?</b>\n<p>This year, we’re really feeling these Cranberry Jell-O shots (link to blog recipe), which we recommend making with Ketel One vodka. In theory, these shots could even replace your typical canned cranberry sauce. If you’re looking for a more traditional drink though, you can’t go wrong with an Old-Fashioned made with Bulleit bourbon. We think it tastes better when sipped near a crackling fire.</p>\n\n<b>How do I send alcohol for Thanksgiving?</b>\n<p>We thought you’d never ask. To send alcohol to your Friendsgiving or Thanksgiving dinner, first type your recipient’s address in the navigation bar to see what’s available in their area. Then just choose your drinks, click checkout, and be sure to mark that you’re sending it as a gift. We’ll send a text message over to your recipient to confirm the time for delivery.

If this is a big apology, maybe going with something showier would fit, like a bottle of aged whiskey or bourbon, tequila, or a pricey bottle of wine they’ve always wanted to try.

Some people are hard to shop for, but most have a preferred drink or brand that they will always appreciate. If you know your hard-to-please uncle swears by Johnnie Walker Red Label the rest of the year, you should spoil him with a bottle of Johnnie Black or Blue, which are higher quality (and pricier) distillations.

Serve up hot toddies with Johnnie Walker scotch or Bulleit Bourbon. Or you can skip Starbucks and make your own spiked peppermint mocha using coffee, Bailey’s Irish Cream, Godiva Chocolate and Rumplemintz liqueurs. </p>\n\n<b>What to drink at Christmas?</b>\n<p>Veuve Clicquot Champagne is an obvious answer if you’re having a fancy Christmas supper.

Don’t believe us? There are actually more recipes for gin cocktails than recipes for any other spirit. In fact, the martini was originally a gin cocktail. That is, until <a href=\"#\">Smirnoff</a>’s marketing team totally stole Gin’s thunder. The original recipe for a martini consists of gin, dry vermouth, bitters (optional), and is garnished with green olives (not optional, unless you hate olives).</p>\n<b>What is Gin made from?</b>\n<p>Gin is grain spirit re-distilled with botanicals (think juniper, rose petals, black pepper, citrus peel, lavender, etc.). The end product of this extensive distillation process is incredibly aromatic, which makes Gin perfect for cocktails like the gin &amp; tonic.</p>\n<b>How do you drink Gin?</b>\n<p>Well, Gin is meant to be mixed. Unlike Vodka &amp; Tequila, you would never do a shot of Gin. The aromatic qualities of Gin lend it to being mixed with everything from plain soda to specialty liqueurs like Campari.</p>\n<b>What are popular Gin drinks?</b>\n<p>Gin cocktails range from the super simple <a href=\"#\">Gin &amp; Tonic</a>, <a href=\"#\">Gimlet</a>, and <a href=\"#\">Classic Gin Martini</a>, to the more complicated Negroni, Singapore Sling, and Corpse Reviver.</p>\n<b>What are the best Gins?</b>\n<p>Gin was originally created by the Dutch, but during the Thirty Years War, the English (who fought against them) fell in love. By the 18th century, the English had taken over the Gin game and were producing it in earnest. Since then, the English have had many successful and delicious Gin brands.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"#\">Tanqueray Gin</a> - Supposedly Frank Sinatra’s favorite Gin. Heavy on the citrus flavors, this Gin is probably the most commonly used in a Dry Gin Martini and other gin cocktails.    </li>\n  <li><a href=\"#\">Beefeater Gin</a> - This Gin has been around since the 1860s and is the very definition of a <a href=\"#\">London Dry Gin</a>. It’s nine botanicals are steeped to give this Gin its characteristic spicy and fruity flavors.</li>\n  <li><a href=\"#\"> Hendrick’s Gin </a>- A modern Gin for people who say they hate Gin. Hendrick’s goes light on the  juniper taste so it isn’t overwhelming.

Learn how to get hard alcohol delivered and order now online or through our app.","url_prefix":false,"html":"<b>What are spirits?</b>\n\n<p>A very valid question, because spirits are a lot of things; Casper the Friendly Ghost, for instance, or that feeling that compels you to wear dumb sweaters during the holidays. But in the context of alcohol, spirits are defined as “liquid containing ethanol and water that is distilled from an alcoholic liquid or mash.” Spirits are stronger than other forms of alcohol like beer or wine because they are distilled, meaning water is removed and a concentrated form of alcohol is left behind.</p>\n\n<b>What are spirits made of?</b>\n\n<p>Spirits—also referred to as liquor—are made out of grains, fruits, or vegetables. The base product goes through a process of alcoholic fermentation, wherein yeast converts natural sugars into ethanol and carbon dioxide. After fermentation is complete, water and impurities are removed through the distillation process. </p>\n\n<b>What are the different kinds of spirits?</b>\n\n<p>Generally speaking, most cocktails or straight spirits served in the United States fall into one of seven categories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li> <a href=\"https://www.saucey.com/vodka\">Casamigos Blanco</a>, which is typically produced from grains or potatoes.</li>\n<li> <a href=\"https://www.saucey.com/gin\">Gin</a>, which is traditionally produced from grain mash and redistilled with various botanicals (most notably, juniper berries, which gives it its distinctive flavor).</li>\n<li> <a href=\"https://www.saucey.com/tequila-mezcal\">Tequila</a>, which is traditionally made out of blue agave (and it’s technically mezcal, but more on that later).</li>\n<li> <a href=\"https://www.saucey.com/whiskey\">-Whiskey</a>, which is made from grains like barley, corn, rye, and wheat.</li>\n<li> <a href=\"https://www.saucey.com/rum\">-Brandy</a>, which is made from wine. </li>\n</ul>\n<b>Are spirits different than liquor?</b>\n\n<p>There’s a lot of debate over the semantics of this between alcohol nerds (and maybe some linguistics nerds, too). The general consensus, though, is that they’re the same thing: it’s the hard stuff when it comes to booze, and they’re usually at at least 40% ABV (alcohol by volume). </p>\n\n<b>Can I get spirits for delivery?</b>\n\n<p>We thought you’d never ask! Saucey is here for all your alcohol delivery needs. Whether you need ingredients to whip up a cocktail ASAP or you’d like to schedule a delivery for the near future, we’ve got you covered in Austin, Chicago, Dallas, Fresno, Jacksonville, Los Angeles, Miami, New York City, Orange County, Orlando, the East Bay, Sacramento, San Diego, San Francisco, San Jose, Seattle, Silicon Valley, the South Bay, Tampa, and Washington DC. </p>\n<ul>\n<li> <a href=\"https://www.saucey.com/blanco--silver-tequila/casamigos-blanco/TQ-CASASIL-750\">Casamigos Blanco</a></li>\n<li> <a href=\"https://www.saucey.com/blanco--silver-tequila/patron-silver/TQ-PATRS-750\">Patrón Silver</a></li>\n<li> <a href=\"https://www.saucey.com/blanco--silver-tequila/don-julio-blanco/TQ-DONJB-750\">Don Julio Blanco</a></li>\n<li> <a href=\"https://www.saucey.com/anejo-tequila/don-julio-1942/TQ-DONJ1942-750\">Don Julio 1942</a></li>\n<li> <a href=\"https://www.saucey.com/bourbon-whiskey/bulleit-bourbon/WS-BULLST-750\">Bulleit Frontier Whiskey</a></li>\n<li> <a href=\"https://www.saucey.com/rye-whiskey/bulleit-rye/WS-BULLRY-750\">Bulleit Rye Whiskey</a></li>\n</ul>","footer":"","google_product":"417","search_tags":"","url_name":"spirits","url_path":"spirits","manual_url_path":false,"discount_override":null,"discount_percent":1,"discount_modifier":null,"base":false,"gift":false,"google_category":"Food, Beverages & Tobacco > Beverages > Alcoholic Beverages > Liquor & Spirits","dynamic_rules":{"min_sell_price":0,"georestricted":[],"max_sell_price":0,"package":false},"dynamic":false,"image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/saucey/image/upload/v1528745666/fdvu1hpnjucop2v8za7u.jpg","parent_id":null,"point_value":0,"point_multiplier":1,"root":true,"is_alcohol":true,"is_tobacco":false,"display_products":false,"display_subcategories":true,"root_category_display":["TOP"],"display_subproducts":false,"sellers":[]},"product_count":247},"NY":{"category":{"_id":"5769c97729c54c2b71db6f0d","enabled":true,"icon":"https://res.cloudinary.com/saucey/image/upload/v1546284150/fac18joihiaxvhrwotct.jpg","name":"New Year's Eve","ordinal":1,"subtitle":"Party Like 2018 Didn't Happen","tag":"NY","updated":"2021-06-17T17:31:57.836Z","url":"new-years-eve","created":"2017-12-22T19:54:00.550Z","interval_end":"2019-01-01T08:00:00.000Z","interval_start":"2018-12-28T08:00:00.000Z","url_name":"new-years-eve","url_path":"new-years-eve","__v":3,"manual_url_path":false,"discount_override":null,"discount_percent":1,"discount_modifier":null,"base":false,"platforms":["ios","android","web"],"gift":false,"dynamic_rules":{"min_sell_price":0,"georestricted":[],"max_sell_price":0,"package":false},"dynamic":false,"parent_id":null,"point_multiplier":1,"point_value":0,"display_products":true,"display_subcategories":false,"display_subproducts":true,"is_alcohol":true,"is_tobacco":false,"root":false,"root_category_display":[]},"product_count":36},"ASFS":{"category":{"_id":"61d4e6d085cd0c0d76803ab9","tag":"ASFS","__v":2,"base":false,"created":"2022-01-05T00:31:12.657Z","discount_modifier":null,"discount_override":null,"discount_percent":null,"display_products":true,"display_subcategories":false,"dynamic":false,"dynamic_rules":{"min_sell_price":0,"georestricted":[],"max_sell_price":0,"package":false},"enabled":false,"gift":false,"is_alcohol":true,"is_tobacco":false,"manual_url_path":false,"name":"2022: A Spirited Fresh Start","parent_id":null,"platforms":[],"point_multiplier":1,"point_value":0,"root":false,"root_category_display":["MAIN_MOBILE"],"sellers":[],"updated":"2022-01-15T01:00:00.498Z","url_name":"fresh-start","url_path":"2022-a-spirited-fresh-start"},"product_count":5},"BBF":{"category":{"_id":"5fbc3c1b6227ad240bd7a895","tag":"BBF","__v":6,"base":false,"created":"2020-11-23T22:47:55.300Z","discount_modifier":null,"discount_override":null,"discount_percent":0.75,"dynamic":false,"dynamic_rules":{"min_sell_price":0,"georestricted":[],"max_sell_price":0,"package":false},"enabled":false,"gift":false,"interval_end":"2021-11-29T08:01:00.000Z","interval_start":null,"is_alcohol":true,"is_tobacco":false,"manual_url_path":false,"name":"Black Friday Steals","parent_id":null,"platforms":["ios","android","web"],"point_multiplier":1,"point_value":0,"root":false,"subtitle":"25% off some bottles. $$ off others.

But that doesn’t mean all their friends and family can’t have a little tipple in their honor. And besides the plethora of wine, liquor and beer available on Saucey, we also have several non-alcoholic beverages like sodas and CBD-infused drinks, chips, candy, and ice cream. Get all the supplies needed to throw a dry (or only slightly wet) baby shower delivered right to your door with Saucey.</p>\n\n<p>Try our Baby Shower combination to get a little something of everything: chocolate, chips, and a little bit of booze for guests who aren’t gestating new life.</p>\n\n\n<b>What is a good gift to bring to a baby shower?</b>\n<p>Something from the parent’s registry. Oh, you didn’t check their gift registry? And the shower is today? Oof. Well, if you can’t buy the typical baby gift like a stroller or clothes (or you want to give a little something just for the parents to enjoy), we recommend showing up to the shower with a NICE bottle of champagne, like Veuve Clicquot or Dom Perignon. Tell the parents they can pop the cork once they pop the baby out.</p>\n\n<b>What are some non-alcoholic drink options that still feel adult?</b>\n<p>There’s the classic Martinelli’s sparkling cider, which looks just like champagne. Or O’Doul’s non-alcoholic beer. But, the new frontier in the beverage industry is CBD-infused drinks. They’re non-alcoholic and don’t contain THC, so they don’t get you high and can be sold even in states without legal marijuana. But the CBD does give a bit of a calming buzz. Try Vybes CBD drinks, which come in delicious flavors like peach ginger, burning mandarin and strawberry lavender.</p>\n\n<b>How do I get beverages and snacks delivered to my baby shower?</b>\n<p>Saucey can deliver all the drinks and snacks you need for your baby shower, directly to your home.

Humans literally figured out how to make wine before they learned how to communicate with written language. So, even if you find yourself rolling your eyes at all the 30-somethings who 'Rosè all day', you must be at least a little curious what all the hype is about. After all, people have been drinking wine for at least 9,000 years. Could that many people really be wrong? Check out this break-down of everything you need to know about wine, and find out which one is right for you.</p>\n\n<h2>What is Wine?</h2>\n\n<p>A delightful alcoholic beverage typically made from fermented grapes and yeast. There's some serious science involved, but different kinds of grapes and yeast produce different kinds of wine.</p> \n\n<p><strong>What Kind of Wines are there?</strong><br>\n\n<strong>Red Wine</strong><br>\n\nRed wine gets it bold coloring and flavors by utilizing more of the grape. Although the juice from most grapes is white or yellow, you can dye it red by extracting colors and flavors from the skin of the grape. Red wine is typically made from dark-colored grape varieties. Typical types of red wine include Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and Malbec.<br>\n\n<strong>White Wine</strong><br>\n\nMade from the pulp of the grapes, with no skin extraction. White wines are typically made from green or yellow grapes. Some popular varieties include Chardonnay, Riesling, and Sauvignon.<br>\n\n<strong>Rosè</strong><br>\n\n<p>A Rosè is the middle ground between red and white wines. It's created by allowing darker-colored grape skins to have contact with with the pulpy mixture during fermentation. This stains the drink, and leaves some flavor from the skin, but not as much as extracting it does. Making it darker than white wine, but lighter than red wine.</p><br>\n\n<strong>Fruit Wines</strong><br>\n\n<p>Although grape wine is the standard, there are some other fruits that make pretty decent wine too. Mostly apples and a variety of berries, fermented in much the same process as grapes. A fruit wine will typically be labeled by it's contents: Apple Wine, Elderberry Wine, Strawberry Wine, etc.</p>\n\n<strong>How do you drink wine?</strong><br>\n\nTo really get this wine thing right, you've got to do a little more than pour and enjoy.<br>\n\n<ul>Serve it at the proper temperature. Red wines are better at room temperature, whereas a white wine should be chilled.</ul>\n<ul>Serve it in the right glass. Red wines need more room to breath, so a wider wine glass is preferred. White's do better without all that breathing space, so a taller flute style glass is best.</ul>\n<ul>Hold your glass the right way. Be sure to hold it by the stem or the base, otherwise the body-heat from your hand will ruin that temperature you worked so hard to achieve.</ul>\n<ul>Swirl, sniff, then sip your wine. </ul>\n\n\n<strong>Popular Food Pairings:</strong><br>\n\nChardonnays and other white wines pair well with seafood, and pasta's with rich creamy sauce. Next time you're enjoying some salmon or chicken Alfredo, chill yourself a bottle of white wine to optimize that flavor.<br>\n\nRosè works particularly well with cheeses of any sort. Next time you serve an appetizer involving a cheese board, bust open a bottle of Rosè. You won't regret it.<br>\n\nPlanning a hearty steak dinner? Best to bust out the red wine, then. A Cabernet or Bordeaux would be a great choice for any red meat entrée.<br>\n\nFeel free to mix it up on your dessert wines, but it's best to make sure that the wine you choose is at least as sweet, or sweeter, than the dessert itself.<br>\n\n<strong>Wines You've Got to Try:</strong><br>\n\nApothic Dark<br>\n\nA red wine blend. It's reasonably priced, deliciously sweet with undertones of coffee and chocolate. The perfect after dinner wine.<br>\n\nChappellet Mountain Cuvee<br>\n\nOne of Napa Valley's top Cabernet. You've got to try this Cabernet Sauvignon the next time you enjoy a steak or chop.<br>\n\nSanta Margherita<br>\n\nAn extra dry blend of pear, melon, lemon, lime, and kiwi flavors. This Pinot Grigio comes straight from Italy, and is best served chilled.<br>\n\nMoet & Chandon<br>\n\nThis Rosè has delightfully fresh aromas of strawberry and cream, paired with a lush mousse of bubbles. The perfect pairing for a decadent dark chocolate dessert.<br></p>","footer":"","google_product":"421","search_tags":"","icon":"https://res.cloudinary.com/saucey/image/upload/v1590193016/aw1xk8nj1iyc1igz1aja.png","url_name":"wine","ordinal":2,"manual_url_path":false,"discount_override":null,"discount_percent":1,"discount_modifier":null,"base":false,"platforms":["ios","android","web"],"gift":false,"google_category":"Food, Beverages & Tobacco > Beverages > Alcoholic Beverages > Wine","dynamic_rules":{"min_sell_price":0,"georestricted":[],"max_sell_price":0,"package":false},"dynamic":false,"created":"2018-06-11T19:33:25.177Z","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/saucey/image/upload/v1528745604/jzznxnzj8woi3yjuorfs.jpg","url_path":"wine","parent_id":null,"point_multiplier":1,"point_value":0,"root":true,"__v":2,"is_alcohol":true,"is_tobacco":false,"display_products":false,"display_subcategories":true,"root_category_display":["TOP"],"display_subproducts":false,"sellers":[]},"product_count":130},"RU":{"category":{"_id":"5769c97729c54c2b71db6efe","enabled":true,"icon":"https://res.cloudinary.com/saucey/image/upload/v1633975341/m12fiwvd6rffvbixb0lx.png","name":"Rum","ordinal":11,"subtitle":"It Fights Scurvy & Boosts Morale","tag":"RU","updated":"2021-12-23T00:27:14.833Z","url":"rum","base":true,"__v":5,"created":"2016-10-20T19:52:56.366Z","discount_override":null,"discount_percent":1,"discount_modifier":null,"platforms":["ios","android","web"],"gift":false,"v2":false,"description":"","seo_title":"Rum Delivery - Online Rum Delivery Near You | Saucey","seo_description":"Get your favorite rum delivered near you within 30 minutes.

Whether you are looking for a bottle of sparkling red wine or a box of dark red wine, Saucey has it all.","url_prefix":true,"html":"<b>How is red wine made?</b>\n\n<p>Like all wines, red wine is made from fermented grape juice. The juice from grapes undergoes a fermentation process during which yeast consumes the sugar in the grapes and produces ethanol and carbon dioxide. Red wine gets its reputation for being “red” because the juice ferments alongside the skins of darker-colored grapes. Depending on the grape variety and how long the fermentation process is, red wines can vary in color from a light ruby to a deep, purplish red.</p>\n\n<b>What are the different kinds of red wine?</b>\n\n<p>Red wine is made from dark-skinned grape varieties like cabernet sauvignon, merlot, zinfandel, syrah (a.k.a. shiraz), malbec, pinot noir, sangiovese, and nebbiolo. Fun fact: Even with deeper-hued grapes, the juice is still light in color; the redness of red wine comes from grape skin.</p>\n\n<p>Red wine is most often produced as a still wine, though sparkling or effervescent red wines like Italian-style lambrusco are also a thing. </p>\n\n<b>Is red wine dry or sweet?</b>\n\n<p>Technically speaking, any wine can be dry or sweet; it all depends on the process the winemaker implements and how much residual sugar—a.k.a the natural sugar that’s left after the fermentation process—ends up in the final product. Wines like cabernet, pinot noir, and syrah tend to be dryer, whereas more full-bodied wines like malbec or zinfandel are sweeter and have more residual sugar (and thus, more alcohol). Dessert wines like port are very much on the sweeter side of things.</p>\n\n<p>Another important distinction: a fruit-forward wine doesn’t necessarily mean a sweet wine; a wine like pinot noir can boast big berry notes, for example, while still being dry. </p>\n\n<b>Can I get red wine delivery?</b>\n\n<p>But of course! Red wine is available for delivery ASAP. Choose from the most popular labels producing pinot noir, merlot, zinfandel, cabernet, syrah, and red blends. Whether you’re looking for an easy sipper on a warm night or something hearty and robust to go along with a rich meal, there’s a red for everyone out there.

Surprises. You know what also goes over super well? Alcohol. Lucky for you, we can help you hit both of those marks in one fell swoop when you opt for alcohol delivery as an anniversary gift. Get champagne, wine, beer, spirits and mixers delivered, and hey, you can even throw in some gummy bears, chocolate or ice cream if you’re really looking to score some extra points.</p>\n\n<b>What is a good anniversary gift?</b>\n<p>Diamonds are forever, or whatever. But who needs forever when you can make someone’s right now absolutely magical? When it comes to getting alcohol delivered for an anniversary, you can always go the traditional route and opt for champagne, sparkling rose, cava or prosecco. But maybe the mood’s more casual and your giftee would dig some hard seltzer or a cider—still sparkling, but not quite so formal. There’s no requirement that bubbles need be involved; maybe your loved one is more into cocktails and would love a bottle of their favorite whiskey, vodka, tequila, mezcal, gin or rum. Or maybe a laid back night with some beer is all they could ever dream of.</p>\n\n<b>Which wine goes best with chocolate?</b>\n<p>Chocolate, eh? Smart move. Red wine and chocolate have become an iconic duo for good reason; the bittersweet flavors of chocolate play beautifully with the fruity nature of red wine. If you’re working with milk chocolate, opt for a lighter bodied pinot noir or something very juicy like a lambrusco is a good way to go. If you’re looking to pair darker chocolate with wine, bigger reds like zinfandel and syrah can be quite magical. But port is king when it comes to pairing wine with chocolate--tough to go wrong there.</p>\n\n<b>How do I get alcohol delivered for an anniversary?</b>\n<p>To send alcohol as an anniversary gift, start by typing your recipient’s address in the navigation bar. This will update your selection to what’s available in their local area. Then pick out the beer, wine, spirits, or snacks you’d like to send as a gift and proceed to checkout. During the checkout process, select the “send as gift” box. You will then be prompted to enter some information about your gift recipient and either schedule a delivery time, or send them a notification that will allow them to do so themselves (so long as they’re around to accept the delivery). </p>","display_products":true,"display_subcategories":false,"display_subproducts":true,"root_category_display":[]},"product_count":7},"EYS":{"category":{"_id":"6127fed01d9fa70d2cb9cc19","tag":"EYS","__v":0,"base":false,"created":"2021-08-26T20:51:28.611Z","discount_modifier":null,"discount_override":null,"discount_percent":null,"display_products":true,"display_subcategories":false,"dynamic":false,"dynamic_rules":{"min_sell_price":0,"georestricted":[],"max_sell_price":0,"package":false},"enabled":false,"gift":false,"is_alcohol":true,"is_tobacco":false,"manual_url_path":false,"name":"Extend Your Summer","parent_id":null,"platforms":["ios","android","web"],"point_multiplier":1,"point_value":0,"root":false,"root_category_display":[],"updated":"2021-08-30T17:00:27.836Z","url_name":"extend-your-summer","url_path":"extend-your-summer"},"product_count":4},"JULY42021":{"category":{"_id":"60dde27a780a9a576f147303","tag":"JULY42021","__v":1,"base":false,"created":"2021-07-01T15:42:50.332Z","discount_modifier":null,"discount_override":null,"discount_percent":null,"display_products":true,"display_subcategories":false,"dynamic":false,"dynamic_rules":{"min_sell_price":0,"georestricted":[],"max_sell_price":0,"package":false},"enabled":false,"gift":false,"is_alcohol":true,"is_tobacco":false,"manual_url_path":false,"name":"Backyard BBQ Bevvies","parent_id":null,"platforms":[],"point_multiplier":1,"point_value":0,"root":false,"root_category_display":[],"subtitle":"Sip.

It isn’t only for celebrations though, you can drink champagne & sparkling wines whenever the heck you want to. </p>\n\n<p>Fun fact: if your bottle says, “champagne” on it, that means it’s from France. Sparkling wine can only be called champagne if it comes from Champagne, France. Sparkling wines like prosecco are free to be made anywhere. </p>\n\n\n<b>What is champagne & sparkling made of?</b>\n\n<p>Champagne & sparkling wines are made up of a mix of fermented grapes. For champagne, they always use three major grapes: Pinot Noir, Pinot Meunier, and Chardonnay. It just needs more time and a different set of procedures to obtain the bubblies. </p>\n\n<b>What makes champagne bubbly?</b>\n\n<p>We all know the bubbles. We all live for the bubbles. But how the bubbles are created is actually a really cool process. You should first know that winemakers have to ferment champagne twice. During the second round of fermentation, they add extra sugar and more yeast. Once they seal the bottle, the fermentation of the sugar and yeast makes an abundance of carbon dioxide. Trapped carbon dioxide = pressure, pressure = bubbles.</p>\n\n\n<b>How do you drink champagne & sparkling? </b>\n<p>It’s best to store champagne & sparkling wines in a cool, dry place. 30 minutes before you drink it, you should put that baby in an ice bucket, or toss it in the fridge. As it chills, prepare the champagne flutes because you’re going to need them. </p>\n\n<b>What’s the shelf-life of champagne & sparkling?</b>\n<p>The consensus is, if it’s not vintage champagne or sparkling wine, you’re good to store it away for three to four years. If it is indeed vintage (very cool of you), you have the thumbs up to store it unopened for around five to ten years. </p>\n\n<b>Can I get champagne & sparkling wine delivery?</b>\n<p>Whether it’s for a celebration or just because, Saucey is always ready to deliver champagne and sparkling wines directly to your doorstep.

White wine tends to be more sweet than <a href=\"/red-wine\">red wine</a>, but there’s are bottles from both camps on the list of the most popular sweet wines:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"/riesling\">Riesling</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"/moscato\">Moscato</a></li>\n  <li>Vouvray</li>\n  <li>Chenin Blanc</li>\n  <li><a href=\"/sauternes\">Sauternes</a></li>\n  <li>Icewine</li>\n  <li>Tokaji</li>\n  <li><a href=\"/port\">Port</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<b>Food Pairing</b>\n<p>You would expect sweet wines to be reserved for dessert, but sweet wines actually pair well with a variety of foods, specifically with Asian and Indian cuisine.</p>\n\n<b>Spicy Food:</b> low alcohol wines work best <br>\n<b>Salty Food:</b> high sweetness wines work best<br>\n<b>Sour Food:</b> high acidity wines work best<br>\n<b>Sweet Sauces:</b> the sweeter the better!<br>\n\n<p>Sadly, sweet wines don’t pair well with chocolate. </p>","parent_id":"59a654babdbc1b69696e58c3","point_multiplier":1,"point_value":0,"url_name":"sweet-wines","url_path":"wine/sweet-wines","root":false,"is_alcohol":true,"is_tobacco":false},"product_count":1},"SC":{"category":{"_id":"5769c97729c54c2b71db6f06","enabled":true,"icon":"","name":"Scotch","ordinal":13,"subtitle":"","tag":"SC","updated":"2021-06-17T17:31:57.836Z","url":"scotch","platforms":["web"],"__v":1,"created":"2016-08-27T01:37:02.946Z","v2":false,"description":"","seo_title":"","seo_description":"","url_prefix":true,"html":"","footer":"","google_product":"1926","search_tags":"","url_name":"scotch","parent_id":"5769c97729c54c2b71db6f03","url_path":"spirits/whiskey/scotch","manual_url_path":false,"discount_override":null,"discount_percent":1,"discount_modifier":null,"base":false,"gift":false,"google_category":"Food, Beverages & Tobacco > Beverages > Alcoholic Beverages > Liquor & Spirits > Whiskey","dynamic_rules":{"min_sell_price":0,"georestricted":[],"max_sell_price":0,"package":false},"dynamic":false,"image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/saucey/image/upload/v1527192863/rachsnrtd5qrpycvnvnr.jpg","point_multiplier":1,"point_value":0,"display_products":true,"display_subcategories":false,"display_subproducts":true,"is_alcohol":true,"is_tobacco":false,"root":false,"root_category_display":[]},"product_count":6},"WS":{"category":{"_id":"5769c97729c54c2b71db6f03","enabled":true,"icon":"https://res.cloudinary.com/saucey/image/upload/v1633975692/ximyoyodz6pcpjzfxaqu.png","name":"Whiskey & Scotch","ordinal":8,"subtitle":"Liquid Sunshine","tag":"WS","updated":"2021-12-23T00:25:52.281Z","url":"whiskey","base":true,"__v":5,"created":"2016-10-20T19:46:37.673Z","discount_override":null,"discount_percent":1,"discount_modifier":null,"platforms":["ios","android","web"],"gift":false,"v2":false,"description":"","seo_title":"Online Whisky Delivery Near You In 30 Minutes | Saucey","seo_description":"Get your favorite whiskey and scotch delivered near you within 30 minutes.

But as anyone who’s had even the briefest encounter with a whiskey enthusiast knows, whiskey is a robust world with much nuance and some seriously hardcore fans.</p>\n\n\n<p>Whiskey can be made from a variety of different grains, such as barley, corn, rye and wheat, and it’s usually aged in wooden casks.</p>\n\n<b>What’s the difference between whiskey and whisky?</b>\n\n<p>Well, the “e,” of course. Beyond that, not much—tomato, tom-ah-toe, essentially. Irish & American types use “whiskey,” whereas it’s generally referred to as “whisky” in Scotland, Canada, Japan and other whisky-producing countries. Don’t worry too much; no one will be that mad if you get them mixed up.</p>\n\n<b>What are the different types of whiskey?</b>\n\n<p>Do you have a couple months to read a full breakdown? No? OK fine, we’ll stick to the basics: </p>\n\n<p>Scotch: It comes from Scotland, believe it or not. It’s made from either malt or barley and production is regulated by very specific laws. Within the category of scotch, there’s single malt, single grain, blended malt, blended grain, and blended Scotch (whew). To be considered scotch, the whisky must be aged in barrels for at least three years. Scotch can be peaty, but it doesn’t have to be. Fun fact: a drinking unit of scotch is referred to as a “dram” rather than a shot. </p>\n\n<p>Bourbon: It’s a classic American style whiskey that’s usually made from corn and barrel-aged. While bourbon isn’t required to be made in Kentucky, that’s pretty much the common association made with bourbon. The mash bill is required to be at least 51% corn, though.</p>\n\n<p>Rye: Another American whiskey. At least 51% must be distilled from rye grain, and it’s aged in charred, new oak barrels. </p>\n\n<p>Irish: Jameson shots are a thing for a reason; Irish whisky tends to be real smooth in comparison to some of the heartier varieties from other parts of the world. It probably goes without saying, but Irish whisky can only be produced in...Ireland.</p>\n\n<p>Japanese: You just said “Suntory time!” to yourself, didn’t you? Japanese whisky was created in the style of scotch whisky and is typically produced as single malt whisky or as a blended whisky.</p>\n\n\n<b>How should I drink whiskey?</b>\n\n<p>A nice whiskey is a thing unto itself and can be sipped neat. But of course, there are also loads of delicious whiskey cocktails you can try out, like a whiskey sour, an old fashioned, a sazerac, and a Manhattan. And obvs, there are classic mixed drinks like whiskey & Coke, whiskey & soda, and whiskey & ginger. </p>\n\n<b>What are the best brands of whiskey?</b>\n<ul>\n<li> <a

delivery is the best way to celebrate a promotion</b>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, you can’t give someone a high-five from another city, but you CAN send them a celebratory alcohol delivery - which is basically a virtual high-five if you think about it. Alcohol is neither an excessive gift, or a fast and cheap bag of chips from a gas station. It’s the perfect gift for celebrating. For real, there’s nothing that says “Hell yeah! You got a promotion! You deserve it!” then swiftly sending over a bottle of champagne, or really any sort of alcohol at all. </p>\n\n<b>What is a good promotion gift?</b>\n\n<p>When you get a promotion, you’re overcome with a sense of pride in knowing that your hard work was seen as such, and it paid off. So what better way to match that shot of confidence than something bubbly and sweet. Prosecco anyone? It screams class and gently hugs the line between satisfying a sweet tooth and getting the party started. If they’re more of a liquor person, definitely don’t hesitate to get them a nice bottle of tequila, or even the supplies to make their own gin & tonic. </p>\n\n<b>How do I send alcohol as a promotion gift?</b>\n\n<p>Once you know, it’s so easy to do! First, plop in your recipient’s address so that you can see what their local selection looks like. See something they’d like? Great! Add it to your cart and select “send as gift” to ensure it’s sent as one. Then, enter their address and either schedule a delivery time, or choose to send the recipient a notification where they can pick their own delivery time. That’s it!

Sake is a rice wine that originated in Japan. It has a similar fermenting process to beer, which is funny because it is, in fact, a wine. To make things more complicated, the word “sake” means “liquor” in Japanese. It’s known for being Japan’s national beverage of choice. Since the country is surrounded by the sea, Sake goes perfectly with seafood as it can hide some of the fishy aftertastes. We love to see it. </p>\n\n\n<b>What is sake made of?</b>\n\n<p>Some say sake is the cleanest alcohol out there. It’s made up of rice and water that is then  fermented and pasteurized. Can’t get any simpler than that. </p>\n\n<b>How strong is sake?</b> \n\n<p>Generally, Sake’s alcohol percentage is around 15% - plus or minus a few. Like that of wine, it is strong enough to get you drunk. When comparing, sake can be 20-30% less strong than whiskey or vodka. Although it will get you buzzing, sake doesn’t have sulfites, and also it has very low histamines, which means you probably won’t have a bad hangover drinking it - unless you drink too much. But hey, we’ve all been there.</p>\n\n<b>Is sake better hot or cold?</b>\n\n<p>First off, to each their own. You can drink sake hot, cold, room temperature, heck you could try freezing it and eating it like a popsicle for all we care. There isn’t a wrong way to sip on this rice wine, but it’s said that the most premium sakes are typically best served chilled. While on the other hand, warming it up is an easy way to mask a cheaper, “regular” sake. \nHiya (premium sake), ones that have more subtle flavors and fragrances, and are made with pure rice that is then milled down to at least 50% of its initial size, are best chilled.

Except maybe my cousin’s wedding where the bar only served rum and butterscotch schnapps. Keep the good times a-flowing at your reception or engagement party by getting a variety of wine, liquor, beer, cider, hard seltzer and even tobacco products delivered to your home or venue, with no delivery fee. Are you a guest looking to send a gift to the newlyweds? Browse our special wedding and engagement gifting category and find some much needed supplies for the happy couple as they turn the page on a new chapter of life together.</p>  \n\n<b>Is alcohol a good wedding gift?</b>\n<p>It sure can be, as long as you pick something that matches both the couple’s taste and the gravitas of their decision to love each other unconditionally for forever (and ever). Unless the couple specifically put “30 pack of Bud Light” on their registry, we say aim for something a little higher end. Something they can maybe save and share later on their anniversary. Johnnie Walker Blue Label is the highest quality blended scotch on the market, and comes in a beautiful box with the bottle swaddled in velvet. Don Julio 1942 is the world’s premier tequila, and would be appreciated by anyone with a passion for agave-based spirits. Veuve Clicquot Champagne is a tried-and true gift for almost any celebration.</p>\n\n<b>Which wine goes best with wedding cake?</b>\n<p>Of course, Champagne is the obvious choice to serve at a wedding, particularly during the cake-cutting. But other sweet wines like moscato d’asti and rose also pair well with a delicate wedding cake. But the most courteous option to your guests is to have a variety of wines (at least one white and one red) and drink options, to suit everyone’s individual tastes. Don’t be like my cousin and only serve rum drinks and butterscotch schnapps just because that’s what you like. Your diabetic guests, at least, will thank you.</p>\n\n<b>How do I send alcohol as a wedding or engagement gift?</b>\n<p>It’s easy. To send alcohol as a wedding or engagement gift, first type the recipient’s address in the navigation bar to see what’s available in their area. Then just choose your drinks, click checkout, and be sure to mark that you’re sending it as a gift. We’ll send a text message over to the happy couple to confirm the time for delivery.</p>","is_alcohol":true,"is_tobacco":false,"manual_url_path":false,"name":"Wedding/Engagement","parent_id":null,"platforms":["web"],"point_multiplier":1,"point_value":0,"root":false,"updated":"2021-06-17T17:31:57.836Z","url_name":"weddingengagement","url_path":"weddingengagement","enabled":true,"display_products":true,"display_subcategories":false,"display_subproducts":true,"root_category_display":[]},"product_count":5},"MAR":{"category":{"_id":"5a458d1a220a19ae6400a031","tag":"MAR","url_path":"poppin-bottles","created":"2017-12-29T00:32:26.339Z","updated":"2020-01-03T20:16:15.756Z","name":"Poppin' Bottles","ordinal":3,"subtitle":"DJ The Magician's Picks For NYE","url_name":"poppin-bottles","__v":0,"icon":"https://res.cloudinary.com/saucey/image/upload/v1514507981/rmowqbiweomojukuq0so.jpg","enabled":false,"manual_url_path":false,"discount_override":null,"discount_percent":null,"discount_modifier":null,"base":false,"platforms":["ios","android","web"],"gift":false,"dynamic_rules":{"min_sell_price":0},"dynamic":false,"point_multiplier":1,"point_value":0},"product_count":2},"TB":{"category":{"_id":"5769c97729c54c2b71db6efc","enabled":true,"icon":"https://res.cloudinary.com/saucey/image/upload/v1633975189/z67e3xetqlbv3lbki1a4.png","name":"Tobacco & Vapes","ordinal":21,"subtitle":"Cigars & Cigarettes","tag":"TB","updated":"2021-10-11T19:24:08.409Z","created":"2016-10-20T19:50:48.530Z","platforms":["ios","android","web"],"__v":4,"url":"tobacco","base":true,"v2":false,"description":"","seo_title":"Tobacco Delivery Near You - Free Delivery In 30 Minutes | Saucey","seo_description":"Get cigarettes delivered near you within 30 minutes. Learn how to get cigarettes delivered and order now online or through our app.","url_prefix":true,"html":"<b>CIGARETTES AND TOBACCO PRODUCTS</b>\n<p>Tobacco in the 21st century has expanded way beyond your regular old paper cigarettes. This ain’t 1619 anymore. With vapes, smoking itself isn’t even required! Tobacco use is becoming safer and more popular than ever, but it can still be such a hassle to find the products you want in stores. Well, let Saucey take care of that for you by delivering your favorite cigarettes, cigars and vapes to your door.</p>\n\n<b>Which cigarette is the best?</b>\n\n<p>Marlboro is by far the preferred brand in America, with 40% of the market share, followed by Newport and Camel. Smaller tobacco brands are rising in popularity, though, mostly among young people who want to avoid Big Tobacco or who prefer cigarettes with fewer additives.</p>\n\n<b>What are menthols?</b>\n\n<p>Basically, a minty cigarette. Newports are the favored brand for menthols in the United States. The menthol helps freshen the taste of the tobacco, and cools your mouth and throat, which can become irritated by harsh smoke. Usually the menthol is put on the tobacco leaf inside the cigarette, but some brands now offer varieties with a special menthol bubble in the filter, which can be bitten into when more menthol flavor is desired.</p>\n\n<b>How do I roll my own cigarettes?</b>\n\n<p>Some people prefer to roll their own cigarettes with loose leaf tobacco, instead of buying ready-rolled packs. Doing so lets the smoker control how much tobacco goes in, so they can create smaller or larger cigarettes than the standard size. Rolling your own can also cut out a lot of the additives found in pre-rolled products. To start, you need rolling papers, filters (optional) and a bag of loose tobacco. Take out a single paper. There should be a crease down the middle. Take a pinch or two of the leaves, and place them in the paper (it’s best to roll over a tray or plate, to catch falling tobacco). If you’re using filters, leave space at one end of the paper and slip the filter end in here. Close the paper up along the crease, “hot dog style,” and carefully roll the paper-wrapped material back and forth with your fingers to get an even dispersal. While still doing the rolling motion with your fingers, tuck the paper edge facing you underneath the other paper edge. Keep rolling in one direction so the paper wraps evenly around the tobacco and filter. Seal the paper edge with saliva. Ta-da, you and your first ever hand-rolled cigarette are ready for the campus quad!</p>\n\n<b>What’s the difference between a cigarette and a cigar?</b>\n\n<p>Cigars and cigarettes are very similar: same plant material, same delivery format, but very different preparations. While cigarettes are a paper shell filled with dried, chopped tobacco leaf (and some other stuff, usually), cigars are made keeping the whole tobacco leaf intact. Cigars are many tobacco leaves which have been dried, pressed and rolled into long brown tubes. Because there is much more tobacco in a cigar than in a cigarette, there are also different methods for smoking them. When smoking a filtered cigarette, it’s almost necessary to suck like using a straw. Cigars are much smokier and do not require such strong inhaling.</p>\n\n<b>Can I get cigarettes, cigars, vapes and Juul for delivery?</b>\n\n<p>Yes! Saucey is one of the only delivery services that delivers cigarettes and other tobacco products such as the Juul, Juul pods, cigars, chewing tobacco, rolling tobacco, rolling papers, nicotine gum, and lighters. \n\n<p>If all you need is a pack of smokes, all good—there’s no order minimum, and you don’t have to order alcohol in order to get cigarette delivery (even though that’s our main thing). Place your order and your tobacco products will be at your front door ASAP.</p>\n\n<b>Best-selling cigarettes for delivery</b>\n<ul>\n<li> <a href=\"https://www.saucey.com/tobacco/marlboro/TB-MARL-GLD\">Marlboro Gold Label</a></li>\n<li> <a href=\"https://www.saucey.com/tobacco/american-spirit/TB-AMER-YEL\">American Spirit Yellow Pack</a></li>\n<li> <a href=\"https://www.saucey.com/tobacco/parliament/TB-PARL-REG\">Parliament Filters</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<b>Best-selling tobacco products for delivery</b>\n<ul>\n<li> <a href=\"https://www.saucey.com/tobacco/camel/TB-CAMEL-BLU\">Camel Blue</a></li>\n<li> <a href=\"https://www.saucey.com/tobacco/marlboro/TB-MARL-RED\">Marlboro Red Label</a></li>\n<li> <a href=\"https://www.saucey.com/tobacco/marlboro/TB-MARL-SLV\">Marlboro Silver Label</a></li>\n</ul>","footer":"","google_product":"435","search_tags":"","url_name":"tobacco","parent_id":null,"url_path":"other/tobacco-vapes","manual_url_path":false,"discount_override":null,"discount_percent":1,"discount_modifier":null,"gift":false,"google_category":"Food, Beverages & Tobacco > Tobacco Products","dynamic_rules":{"min_sell_price":0,"georestricted":[],"max_sell_price":0,"package":false},"dynamic":false,"point_value":0,"point_multiplier":1,"root":false,"is_alcohol":false,"is_tobacco":true,"display_products":true,"display_subcategories":false,"root_category_display":["MAIN_MOBILE"],"display_subproducts":true,"sellers":[]},"product_count":53},"TQ":{"category":{"_id":"5769c97729c54c2b71db6ef9","enabled":true,"icon":"https://res.cloudinary.com/saucey/image/upload/v1633975419/f9dbyairltm2p2j2dgma.png","name":"Tequila & Mezcal","ordinal":9,"subtitle":"Just Don't Text Your Ex","tag":"TQ","updated":"2021-12-23T00:26:22.576Z","url":"tequila-mezcal","base":true,"__v":5,"created":"2016-08-27T01:36:52.621Z","v2":false,"description":"","seo_title":"Tequila & Mezcal Delivery Near You In 30 Minutes | Saucey","seo_description":"Get your favorite tequila and mezcal delivered near you within 30 minutes.

The heart of the agave plant, known as the piña, is cooked and roasted in a pit oven, which is where the signature smoky flavor of mezcal comes from. The roasted piña ferments and is then aged in oak barrels (mezcal that is not aged is referred to as “joven”) and double distilled.</p>\n\n<p>Tequila is a mezcal specifically made from blue agave and must come from the Mexican state of Jalisco. The agave plant is also steamed rather than roasted, which is why tequila does not have that same smoky flavor as mezcal. \nBottom line: Tequila is a mezcal, but mezcal is not a tequila.</p>\n\n<b>Can I get tequila or mezcal delivery?</b>\n\n<p>Absolutely. Saucey delivers tequila and mezcal and anything else you might need to make your favorite cocktails straight to your doorstep, ASAP.</p>\n\n<b>What are some good tequila and mezcal cocktails I can get for delivery?</b>\n\n<p>Obvs, margaritas are one of the most iconic cocktails of all time, and for good reason: a marg made with good tequila is really, really tough to beat. Palomas, a tequila-based cocktail that incorporates lime juice and grapefruit soda or grapefruit juice and soda water, are also very delicious. And of course, a good tequila absolutely can and should be sipped neat. Taking shots with salt and lime isn’t a traditional Mexican method of consumption, but whatever floats your mezcal boat.</p>\n\n<p>A nice mezcal is likewise meant to be sipped neat, so all the complex flavors can be taken in. But swapping out tequila for mezcal in popular tequila cocktails is increasingly commonplace, so get after that mezcal margarita if you want it.</p>\n\n<b>Saucey’s favorite tequilas and mezcals</b>\n<ul>\n<li> <a href=\"https://www.saucey.com/blanco--silver-tequila/casamigos-blanco/TQ-CASASIL-750\">Casamigos Blanco</a></li>\n<li> <a href=\"https://www.saucey.com/blanco--silver-tequila/patron-silver/TQ-PATRS-750\">Patrón Silver</a></li>\n<li> <a href=\"https://www.saucey.com/blanco--silver-tequila/don-julio-blanco/TQ-DONJB-750\">Don Julio Blanco</a></li>\n<li> <a href=\"https://www.saucey.com/anejo-tequila/don-julio-1942/TQ-DONJ1942-750\">Don Julio 1942</a></li>\n</ul>","footer":"","google_product":"2220","search_tags":"","url_name":"tequila-mezcal","parent_id":"5769c97729c54c2b71db6ef5","url_path":"spirits/tequila-mezcal","manual_url_path":false,"discount_override":null,"discount_percent":1,"discount_modifier":null,"platforms":["ios","android","web"],"gift":false,"google_category":"Food, Beverages & Tobacco > Beverages > Alcoholic Beverages > Liquor & Spirits > Tequila","dynamic_rules":{"min_sell_price":0,"georestricted":[],"max_sell_price":0,"package":false},"dynamic":false,"image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/saucey/image/upload/v1527192733/flr8os5a17meluwwbuxc.jpg","point_value":0,"point_multiplier":1,"root":false,"is_alcohol":true,"is_tobacco":false,"display_products":true,"display_subcategories":false,"root_category_display":["MAIN_MOBILE"],"display_subproducts":true,"sellers":[]},"product_count":48},"TGT":{"category":{"_id":"6194439e7d5cf20d6b505db7","tag":"TGT","__v":1,"base":false,"created":"2021-11-16T23:49:50.033Z","discount_modifier":null,"discount_override":null,"discount_percent":null,"display_products":true,"display_subcategories":false,"dynamic":false,"dynamic_rules":{"min_sell_price":0,"georestricted":[],"max_sell_price":0,"package":false},"gift":false,"is_alcohol":true,"is_tobacco":false,"manual_url_path":false,"name":"Tequila Gifts","parent_id":"61c279b1f5aca00d7937aa38","platforms":["ios","android","web"],"point_multiplier":1,"point_value":0,"root":false,"root_category_display":[],"sellers":[],"subtitle":"Best Tequila gifts this holiday season","updated":"2021-12-22T23:12:44.032Z","url_name":"tequila-gifts","url_path":"tequila-gifts","enabled":true,"icon":"http://res.cloudinary.com/saucey/image/upload/v1640214761/zjaa2ml2yyq6kohwyzwi.png"},"product_count":6},"BBHS":{"category":{"_id":"61b7cdad1a1d4a0d65f14862","tag":"BBHS","__v":2,"base":false,"created":"2021-12-13T22:48:13.588Z","discount_modifier":null,"discount_override":null,"discount_percent":1,"display_products":true,"display_subcategories":false,"dynamic":false,"dynamic_rules":{"min_sell_price":0,"georestricted":[],"max_sell_price":0,"package":false},"gift":false,"is_alcohol":true,"is_tobacco":false,"manual_url_path":false,"name":"The Big Holiday Bottle Sale","parent_id":null,"platforms":[],"point_multiplier":1,"point_value":0,"root":false,"root_category_display":["MAIN_MOBILE"],"sellers":[],"subtitle":"Take 25% off our curated collection","updated":"2022-01-03T23:28:45.505Z","url_name":"the-big-holiday-bottle-sale","url_path":"the-big-holiday-bottle-sale","enabled":false,"interval_start":"2021-12-17T22:00:00.000Z","interval_end":"2021-12-31T23:26:00.000Z"},"product_count":3},"CO":{"category":{"_id":"5769c97729c54c2b71db6f04","enabled":true,"icon":"https://res.cloudinary.com/saucey/image/upload/v1633975242/rfesyhmklyhhupqywota.png","name":"Cocktails & Combos","ordinal":14,"subtitle":"Mixers, Ice & More","tag":"CO","updated":"2021-12-23T00:28:41.483Z","url":"cocktails-combos","base":true,"__v":5,"created":"2016-08-27T01:22:58.798Z","discount_override":null,"discount_percent":1,"discount_modifier":null,"platforms":["ios","android","web"],"gift":false,"v2":false,"description":"","seo_title":"Pre-Made & DIY Cocktails Delivery Near You In 30 Minutes | Saucey","seo_description":"Get your favorite pre-made cocktails delivered near you within 30 minutes.

That’s because unlike red wine, which is the result of grape juice fermenting alongside the skins, grape juice that ferments into white wine is removed from its skins right away.</p>\n\n<p>That being said, white wines do tend to come from green-ish or yellow-ish grape varieties, though pinot grigio is one example where a darker-skinned grape is used to produce a white wine. </p>\n\n<p>Generally speaking, white wines ferment at cooler temperatures than red wines and aren’t really meant to be aged like red wines are. They’re also meant to be consumed cold. Room-temp white wine is...not chill.</p>\n\n<b>What are the different kinds of white wine?</b>\n\n<p>There are a whole bunch of varieties, but for the sake of simplicity, we’ll stick to the most popular ones: chardonnay, riesling, pinot grigio/pinot gris, chenin blanc, sauvignon blanc, gewürztraminer, and muscat/moscato.</p>\n\n<b>Is white wine dry or sweet?</b>\n\n<p>It very much depends! “Dry” describes a wine that has low levels of residual sugar, a.k.a. the naturally occurring sweetness in grape juice that is turned into alcohol during the fermentation process. When someone wants a dry white wine, chances are they’ll end up with a sauvignon blanc or a pinot grigio.</p>\n\n<p>Someone in search of a sweetish white wine might pick up a bottle of riesling or gewürztraminer to pair with some spicy foods, or if you’re looking for something even sweeter, moscato will do the trick.</p>\n\n<p>There are a number of other attributes commonly thrown around when it comes to white wine, like chardonnays that are “oaky,” “buttery,” and “creamy.” Or sauv blanc that is “crisp,” “minerally,” and “grassy.” </p>\n\n<b>Can I get white wine delivery?</b>\n\n<p>You know it. That white wine deliciousness you’ve been craving can be on your doorstep ASAP. Pick out a bottle of sauv blanc for a backyard BBQ or hunker down with a rich chardonnay alongside a decadent pasta dish. Saucey’s got you covered. </p>\n\n<b>Saucey’s favorite white wines</b>\n<ul>\n<li> <a href=\"https://www.saucey.com/sauvignon-blanc/joel-gott/WW-JOELG-SAUV\">Joel Gott Sauvignon Blanc</a></li>\n<li>
